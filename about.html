        PDX Kids Code Club started out slowly & organically in 2016 after my son  
        showed a few friends a website game we had built together. These 
        friends also wanted to learn how to make their sites & games & soon enough 
        it turned into weekly planned after school mettings where I'd help the kids 
        build up their own projects little by little, learning what they needed to 
        learn as new ideas came to them. After a few months, my son's little group of 
        friends had snow balled into three dozen kids from his school, across all grades 
        <img id="pic1" src="assets/pic6.jpg" align="right">
        in their elementary school who had heard about what they had been doing one by one. 
        Fast-forward to now & we have five chapters throughout Portland, over 400 members & 
        hundreds of volunteers making this club happen.
