          If your child would like to join, please pick any <a href="chapter.html">Chapter</a> of your
           choice, whether that be based off of location or what day of the 
           week works for your schedule, & see information below on the two 
           sub-groups of each chapter for their age range & tuition prices. 
           Once you have decided on a chapter, feel free to drop in & observe a meet-up with your child & 
           you can sign them up in person towards the end of the meet-up. If you'd prefer 
           to sign your child up via email, feel free to fill out the email form below & 
           we will get that started. Tuition is due at the first meet-up of every month for that month.
           Unfortunatly we cannot give partial refunds if your child misses a weekly meet-up after 
           tuition has been paid but you can stop attending/paying for full months & start back up 
           at any time. If your financial situation makes paying tuition difficult, please
           reach out to our team via the email form below & make note of your situation. We may have an 
           open sponsored tuition spot available based on what Chapter(s) work for you & your family income.

                Our Turquoise group is for the younger half of our club. We try to have a 4:1 member to volunteer 
                ratio so that those who need help have it no matter what. Our older Amethyst group is also around during 
                Turquoise's meet-ups & often times will jump in to help & mentor when they can. Members of the Turquoise group work on 
                one small solo project a month & one group project by the end of each month.

             Our Amethyst group is for our older half of the group. We try to have a 6:1 member/volunteer ratio. Each member of the Amythst group works on two personal projects & one group 
             (3-5 members per group) project a month. Our Amythyst members are also welcomed to be volunteers at other Chapter meet-ups, volunteering 
             for six meet-ups (18 hours) a month pays your tuition for the following month.
